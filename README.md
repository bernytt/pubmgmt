## Dependency

[gin][1] as web framework
[go-mailer][2] as mailer with a web api
[bolt][3] store database
[jwt-go][4] authentication
[kinpin][5] command-line option parser

NOW IT'S IN EARLY STATE(backend is almost done) BUT... FELL FREE TO HAVE A TRY :)

I had only code `subversion` and a very simple `shell` module.
YOU CAN WRITE MODULES BY YOUR OWN. JUST IMPLEMENT THE `Module interface`
